# Task-Management-System
We built a Task Management System (SQL) in pgAdmin4 using the concepts of DBMS and connected the backend database with an easy-to-use GUI created in python using Jupyter notebook, to search, manipulate and store projects, tasks, employee details, task updates,etc. We prepared an in-depth SRS documentation, designed an ER model, translated it into a relational schema, and ran over 40 SQL queries.
